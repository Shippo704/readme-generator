  ## Description 

  This code will generate a README file based on user responses to a series of questions.

  ## Installation

  Before running this code, the user must navigate to the index.js location in their terminal, then execute the command npm -install.

  ## Usage

  To run the code, the user must execute the command node index.js into the terminal. When this command is run, there will be a series of questions that the user will be prompted to answer.

  ## Tests

  To test the code, a user can input any default values they wish. Even if the inputs are left blank (excepting the license), the README.md will still be generated. The sections will just be blank.
